        <h1>More about us </h1>
        <P>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
            pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account
             of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
              truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or 
              avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not 
              know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely 
              painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain 
              of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in 
              which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
              which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some 
              advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to
               enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that 
               produces no resultant pleasure?"</P>
